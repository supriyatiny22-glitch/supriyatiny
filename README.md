##In this project, I developed and explored a text summarisation tool to understand how large amounts of information can be condensed into shorter, meaningful summaries. As someone who often works with long articles, study materials, and project documents, I wanted to learn how natural language processing techniques can automatically extract the main ideas from any text. This project helped me understand not only how the summarisation process works but also how the code is obtained, the platform I used to learn it, and the various purposes this tool can serve.

To begin with, I obtained the code for the text summarisation tool from online learning platforms and open-source resources. Websites such as GitHub, online tutorials, and Python-based learning portals provided clear examples and ready-made scripts that helped me understand the basic structure of the program. By studying different code samples, I was able to see how text is tokenised, processed, and summarised using different models. These online resources guided me step by step and made the learning process much easier. I also referred to educational videos and articles to understand the logic behind extractive and abstractive summarisation.

The platform I used throughout this project was Python, mainly because it is one of the most popular and beginner-friendly languages for natural language processing. I worked with tools like NLTK, spaCy, and Gensim to understand extractive summarisation, and I explored the HuggingFace Transformers library to learn about more advanced abstractive methods. I practised writing and running the code using Google Colab, which gave me the advantage of running Python programs without installing anything. This cloud-based platform also allowed me to experiment freely, try different versions of the summarisation code, and analyse the results instantly.

The main purpose of this text summarisation tool is to reduce lengthy documents into shorter summaries while keeping the meaning intact. In my experience, this is extremely useful for students and professionals who need to handle large volumes of information. By using this tool, I was able to quickly understand long articles and research papers without reading every line. It also helped me identify the most important points in a document, which is very helpful for writing assignments, preparing notes, or studying for exams. This tool can also be used in areas like journalism, law, education, and business, where quick and accurate understanding of information is essential.

Working on this project has given me a clearer understanding of how machine learning and natural language processing can solve real-world problems. I learned how to collect code from online platforms, how to use Python to implement it, and how summarisation models help in extracting key ideas from long text. Overall, this project has improved my technical skills, enhanced my learning experience, and shown me how useful text summarisation tools can be in daily academic and professional work.
